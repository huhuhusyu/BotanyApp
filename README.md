# BotanyApp
This is a mobile application using Android Studio and Java Language. This application wishes to help the users so that they may keep track of current temperature and 
humidity levels throughout the day. The simpleness of the application allows them to use this 
application anywhere, whether they are spending the day outside, or even resting in their homes. 
The users do not have to worry about buying expensive equipment to tell the temperature or 
humidity because this application is a combination of two bulky equipment, into one lovely 
application.
